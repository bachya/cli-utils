CLIUtils is a library of functionality designed to alleviate common tasks and
headaches when developing command-line (CLI) apps in Ruby.

# *Updating from 1.x.x to 2.0.0?*

The big difference is schema changes for Validators, Behaviors, and Pre-Post
Actions. Make sure you read the [wiki](https://github.com/bachya/cliutils/wiki "CLIUtils Wiki").

# Why?

It's fairly simple:

1. I love developing Ruby-based CLI apps.
2. I found myself copy/pasting common code from one to another.
3. I decided to do something about it.

# Libraries

CLIUtils offers:

* **PrettyIO:** some basic CLI sugar
* **Messaging:** a system to display nicely-formatted messages to one or more tagets
* **Configuration:** a app configuration manager
* **Prefs:** a preferences prompter and manager

...along with plenty of documentation:

* [Wiki](https://github.com/bachya/cliutils/wiki "CLIUtils Wiki")
* [YARD documentation](http://rubydoc.info/github/bachya/cliutils/master/frames "YARD Documentation")

# Compatibility

CLIUtils is certified against the following:

* Ruby 2.1.1
* Ruby 2.1.0
* Ruby 2.0.0
* Ruby 1.9.3
* rbx
* rbx-2

# Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```bash
$ gem 'cliutils'
```

And then execute:

```bash
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself:

```bash
$ gem install cliutils
```

# Usage

```Ruby
require 'cliutils'
```

If you want to mix in everything that CLIUtils has to offer:

```Ruby
include CLIUtils
```

# Can I use it with...?

I often get asked how nicely CLIUtils plays with other Ruby-based CLI
libraries (like Dave Copeland's excellent
[Methadone](https://github.com/davetron5000/methadone "Methadone") and
[GLI](https://github.com/davetron5000/gli "GLI")). Answer: they play very
nicely. I use CLIUtils in
[Sifttter Redux](https://github.com/bachya/Sifttter-Redux "Sifttter Redux")
(which is built on GLI) and
[ExpandSync](https://github.com/bachya/ExpandSync "ExpandSync") (which is built
  on Methadone).
