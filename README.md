CLIUtils is a library of functionality designed to alleviate common tasks and headaches when developing command-line (CLI) apps in Ruby.

# Why?

It's fairly simple:

1. I love developing Ruby-based CLI apps.
2. I found myself copy/pasting common code from one to another.
3. I decided to do something about it.

# Libraries

CLIUtils offers:

* PrettyIO: nicer-looking CLI messages
* Messaging: a system to display nicely-formatted messages to one or more tagets
* Configuration: a app configuration manager
* Prefs: a preferences prompter and manager

...along with plenty of documentation:

* [Wiki](https://github.com/bachya/cliutils/wiki "CLIUtils Wiki")
* [YARD documentation](http://rubydoc.info/github/bachya/cliutils/master/frames "YARD Documentation")

# Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```bash
$ gem 'cliutils'
```

And then execute:

```bash
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself:

```bash
$ gem install cliutils
```

# Usage

```Ruby
require 'cliutils'
```

If you want to mix in everything that CLIUtils has to offer:

```Ruby
include CLIUtils
```

# Can I use it with...?

I often get asked how nicely CLIUtils plays with other Ruby-based CLI libraries (like Dave Copeland's excellent [Methadone](https://github.com/davetron5000/methadone "Methadone") and [GLI](https://github.com/davetron5000/gli "GLI")). Answer: they play very nicely. I use CLIUtils in [Sifttter Redux](https://github.com/bachya/Sifttter-Redux "Sifttter Redux") (which is built on GLI) and [ExpandSync](https://github.com/bachya/ExpandSync "ExpandSync") (which is built on Methadone).

# Known Issues

* LoggerDelegator doesn't currently know what to do with `messenger.prompt`, so you'll have to manually log a `debug` message if you want that information logged.
